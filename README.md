# 3D Avatar Viewer (Flutter + o3d)
A lightweight Flutter app that loads and shows a 3D avatar using the o3d package (GLB/GLTF support), with basic camera controls (rotate / zoom) and local model loading.
This project loads the avatar directly from a URL generated by the Ready Player Me website — no assets folder or local model files required.

   Copy the .glb model URL provided after export
   Paste that URL inside the Flutter app code to display your avatar
