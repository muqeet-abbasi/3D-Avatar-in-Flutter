# 3D Avatar Viewer (Flutter + o3d)

A lightweight Flutter app that loads and shows a 3D avatar using the **o3d** package (GLB/GLTF support), with basic camera controls (rotate / zoom).  
The app loads the avatar **directly from a URL** generated by the Ready Player Me website — no assets folder or local model files required.
